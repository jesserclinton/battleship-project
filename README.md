### TODO
1. server/client communication
  * load_players

1. add timer update
1. improve css

### FIXME
* "refresh" error!!!
* inconsistent naming conventions

### Suggestions
* make the display size smaller for larger gameboards
* add server states
* multiple games at once
* limit players per pc
* use a css framework (Bootstrap, etc.)
* use imgs in game squares

### Proposals
* separate html into separate files again
> currently, it is difficult to work with AJAX and node together
