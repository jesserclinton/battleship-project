          The rules are simple:<br>Tactically attack places on the map
          to sink enemy ships. Landing a hit on an enemy ship scores a
          point for the player <em>(Players do <strong>not</strong> have to shoot in turn,
          they may fire as fast as they can)</em>. Once all of the player's
          ships have been sunk they will no longer be able to shoot for the
          rest of the round. Once all of the players (or all but one)
          have been sunk, the game ends, and the points are tallied up.
          The player with the most points wins!
